Alephium's stateful UTXO model combines the advantages of the UTXO and
account models. It supports mutable states for smart contracts, like
those found in Ethereum, while leveraging the security benefits of the
immutable UTXO model for assets, like those found in Bitcoin.

Alephium is also a sharded blockchain, right now there are `4` groups and
`16` chains running on `Mainnet`.

This architecture and design is quite unique in the space and has
implications to Alephium's programming model, token design, asset
transfer and management approach, and more.

Alephium extension wallet helps users to store and manage their assets
such as the native `ALPH` token, other fungible tokens as well as NFTs
on the Alephium blockchain.  It also enables dApps to securely
interact with the wallets, allowing dApp users to sign transactions,
interact with the smart contracts, etc right from the browser.

Alephium's full node also comes with a built-in node
wallet, which could be useful if you are a
developer. Alephium team is also finalizing the work for the
[Ledger support](/wallet/ledger).

Other than the wallets that are built and maintained by the team,
there are also community built wallets such as Sesame
wallet and Sahhar
wallet.

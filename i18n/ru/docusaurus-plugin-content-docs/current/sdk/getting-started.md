Alephium offers a powerful Typescript
SDK that makes it easy to
connect to and interact with the blockchain. Some of the
functionalities it provides are:

- Query on-chain states
- Build and submit transactions
- A CLI tool for compiling, testing and deploying smart contracts
- Libraries for building React/Nextjs web interfaces

## Install

The [@alephium/web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alephium/web3)
is the core package that offers dev-friendly APIs to interact
with the Alephium blockchain and develop dApps on it.

```
npm install --save @alephium/web3
```

## Connect to Alephium

To begin developing your dApp, the first step is to establish a connection to the
Alephium network. `NodeProvider` is an abstraction of a connection to the Alephium
network, it exposes all the full node
[APIs](https://node.mainnet.alephium.org/docs) in Typescript.

You can get a `NodeProvider` instance by:

```typescript
import { NodeProvider } from '@alephium/web3'

const nodeProvider = new NodeProvider('http://localhost:22973')
```

If the full node you are connecting to requires API
Key, you can specify it like this:

```typescript
const API_KEY = // alephium.api.api-key from your full node config
const nodeProvider = new NodeProvider('http://localhost:22973', API_KEY)
```

Some utility functions in the SDK rely on the global provider. You
need to set it like this to ensure these functions work correctly:

```typescript
import { web3 } from '@alephium/web3'

web3.setCurrentNodeProvider(<nodeURL>)
```

## Learn More

Blocks and transactions are the core concepts of any blockchains. We
will learn how to use the Typescript SDK to build and
query transactions as well as sign and
submit them. We will also learn how to query
and subscribe to the blocks information.

Smart contract support is one of Typescript SDK's main focuses. We
will learn how to use the CLI tool to [compile and deploy](./cli.md)
contracts. We will also learn how to use the libraries and frameworks
to [test and debug](./testing-and-debugging.md) contracts during
development as well as interacting
with them after they are deployed.

To ease the web interface integration, [Web3 React](./web3-react.md)
package is included in the Typescript SDK to provide a set of react
components and hooks to help with wallet connection and blockchain
interaction.

Typescript SDK also provides utilities to [work with](./events.md)
contract and system events, [encode & decode](./codec.md) transactions
and contracts and [more](./utils.md). Dive in to explore the powerful
features offered by the Typescript SDK!

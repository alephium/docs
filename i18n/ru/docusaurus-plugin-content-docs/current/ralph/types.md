Ralph is a statically typed language, but you don't need to specify the type for local variables and constants thanks to type inference.
All types of Ralph are value types, i.e. they are always copied when they are used as function arguments or assigned.
Currently, Ralph only supports the following data types:

### Primitive Types

#### U256

```rust
// The type of `a` ... `d` is U256.
let a = 10
let b = 10u
let c = 1_000_000_000
let d = 1e18
```

#### I256

```rust
// The type of `a` ... `d` is I256.
let a = -10
let b = 10i
let c = -1_000_000_000
let d = -1e18
```

#### Bool

```rust
// The type of `a` and `b` is Bool.
let a = false
let b = true
```

#### ByteVec

```rust
// ByteVec literals must start with `#` followed by a hex string.
let a = #00112233
// ByteVec concatenation
let b = #0011 ++ #2233 // `b` is #00112233
// Empty ByteVec
let c = #
```

#### Address

```rust
// Address literals must start with `@` followed by a valid base58 encoded Alephium address.
let a = @1DrDyTr9RpRsQnDnXo2YRiPzPW4ooHX5LLoqXrqfMrpQH
```

#### String

Ralph does not have a native type for strings, but you can define string literals which are encoded in `ByteVec`.

```rust
// String literals starts with `b`.
let a = b`Hello`
let b = b`World`
let c = a ++ b` ` ++ b
```

### Tuple

Ralph supports tuples, which are values that contain fixed number of
elements, each with its own type.

```rust
// Function that returns a tuple of 3 elements
fn foo() -> (U256, Boolean, ByteVec) {
  return 1, false, #00
}

// Destructure the tuple, `a` is immutable, `b` is mutable.
// `_` is the anonymous variable to ignore the unnecessary variable
let (a, mut b, _) = foo()
```

### Fixed Size Array

The syntax for fixed-size arrays is influenced by Rust.

```rust
// The type of `a0` is [U256; 4]
let a0 = [0, 1, 2, 3]

// The type of `a1` is [[U256, 2]; 2]
let a1 = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]

// The type of `a2` is [I256; 3]
let a2 = [0i; 3]

// The type of `a3` is [ByteVec; 4]
let a3 = [#00, #11, #22, #33]
```

### Struct

In Ralph, Structs can be globally defined and can contain fields that are either mutable or immutable. However, to assign a value to a field, all of the field selectors must be mutable.
E.g. in order to set `foo.x.y.z = 123`, all `foo`, `x`, `y`, and `z` must be mutable.

```rust
// Structs have to be defined globally
struct Foo { x: U256, mut y: U256 }
struct Bar { z: U256, mut foo: Foo }

Contract Baz() {
  ...

  // f.y = 3 won't work as f is immutable despite the field y being mutable
  let f = Foo { x: 1, y: 2 }

  // ff = f won't work as ff.x is immutable despite ff and ff.y being mutable
  let mut ff = Foo { x: 1, y: 2 }
  ff.y = 3 // This works as both ff and y are mutable

  // b.foo.y = 5 won't work as b is immutable
  let b = Bar { z: 4, foo: f }

  let mut bb = Bar { z: 5, foo: f }
  bb.foo.y = 6 // This works as bb, foo, and y are all mutable

  ...
}
```

In Ralph, structs are value types, not reference types. When assigned to a new struct variable, it copies all fields to the new struct variable:

```rust
struct Foo { x: U256, mut y: U256 }
Contract Bar() {
  pub fn bar() -> () {
    let foo0 = Foo { x: 0, y: 1 }
    let mut foo1 = foo0
    foo1.x = 1 // modifying foo1.x will not change foo0.x
    assert!(foo0.x == 0, 0)
    assert!(foo1.x == 1, 0)
  }
}
```

Ralph also supports destructuring struct, and the syntax is similar to TypeScript:

```rust
struct Foo { x: U256, y: U256 }
Contract Bar() {
  pub fn bar() -> () {
    let foo = Foo { x: 0, y: 1 }
    let Foo { mut x, y } = foo
    x = 1

    // the variables `x` and `y` already exist, we create two new variables `x1` and `y1`
    let Foo { x: x1, y: y1 } = foo
  }
}
```

### Map

The map data structure is currently available in the [devnet release](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-stack/tree/master/devnet) and the [testnet release](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-stack/tree/master/devnet) of the full node.

In Ralph, Maps are defined as global contract attributes, eliminating the need for initialization. The syntax is `mapping[KeyType, ValueType] mapName` where the `KeyType` can be any primitive types (Bool, U256, I256, Address, ByteVec), and the `ValueType` can be any type.

Under the hood, each Map entry is constructed as a subcontract of the current contract. Therefore, creating a map entry entails a minimal contract deposit, easily done using the built-in function `mapEntryDeposit!()`.

There are 3 essential built-in map methods `insert!, remove!, contains!` (see [doc](https://docs.alephium.org/ralph/built-in-functions/#map-functions)). Map values can be accessed and updated with the bracket syntax `map[key] = newValue`. Below are some examples illustrating their usage. For more comprehensive examples, refer to the [blind-auction](https://github.com/alephium/ralph-example/tree/master/blind-auction) repository and the [unit tests here](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/blob/master/test/contract.test.ts#L448-L477).

```rust
Contract Counters() {
  // All maps must be defined here with `mapping[KeyType, ValueType]`, before events and constants
  mapping[Address, U256] counters

  @using(preapprovedAssets = true)
  pub fn create() -> () {
    let key = callerAddress!()
    let depositor = key
    // The depositor will deposit a minimal ALPH deposit for the new map entry which is a subcontract
    counters.insert!(depositor, key, 0)
  }

  pub fn count() -> () {
    let key = callerAddress!()
    let value = counters[key]
    // Update the map entry value
    counters[key] = value + 1
  }

  pub fn clear() -> U256 {
    let key = callerAddress!()
    let depositRecipient = key
    let value = counters[key]
    // Each map entry removal redeems the map entry deposit
    counters.remove!(depositRecipient, key)
    return value
  }

  pub fn contains() -> Bool {
    // Check the existence of map entry
    return counters.contains!(callerAddress!())
  }
}

TxScript CreateCounter(counters: Counters) {
  let from = callerAddress!()
  counters.insert{from -> ALPH: mapEntryDeposit!()}() // Approve minimal deposit for creating the map entry
}
```

---

Alephium's protocol design and node implementation focuses on efficiency, allowing it to operate smoothly on consumer-grade computers. This accessibility enables a wider range of users to participate in the network.

This section provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions for setting up and managing Alephium full nodes in various environments using different tools.

### Why Run a Full Node?

- **Network Participation**: Contribute to the security and stability of the Alephium network.
- **Decentralization**: Help maintain a decentralized network structure by adding more nodes.
- **Support for dApps and Services**: Ensure optimal performance and reliability for your decentralized applications and services by running your own node.

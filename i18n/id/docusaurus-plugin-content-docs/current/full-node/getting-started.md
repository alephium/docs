You can run your Alephium full node using either
[Docker](#using-docker) or [Java](#using-java). This
guide will first demonstrate how to run the Alephium full node on the
`Mainnet`, and then discuss the differences for `Testnet` and
`Devnet` setups.

## Using Docker

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed.
- Clone the [alephium-stack](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-stack/tree/master/mainnet) repository.

### Start your node

1. Open search and type in `Terminal` (for Mac or Linux) or `Command Prompt` (for Windows).
2. In the Terminal/Command Prompt, run the following command:

```shell
> cd $path-to-alephium-stack/mainnet
> docker-compose up -d
```

## Using Java

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that Java (11 or 17 recommended) is
  [installed](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html)
  on your computer.
- Download file `alephium-x.x.x.jar` from Github
  release (do
  not double-click it, as it can not be launched this way).

### Start your node

1. Open search and type in `Terminal` (for Mac or Linux) or `Command Prompt` (for Windows).
2. In the Terminal/Command Prompt, run the following command:

```shell
> cd $your-jar-file-path
> java -jar alephium-x.x.x.jar
```

ðŸŽ‰ _**Tada, your node is running**_

- Your node will start to sync with the network. The initial sync may take some time. Your node is fully synced once the block heights in the terminal logs matches the latest block heights on the [explorer](https://explorer.alephium.org).
- If you close the terminal the node will be turned off.
- All of the blockchain data is stored in `.alephium` under your home folder[^1].

## Testnet

Full node on `Testnet` can be launched using the same steps as
`Mainnet`. However, update the following configurations in the `${ALEPHIUM_HOME}/user.conf` file:

```conf
alephium.network.network-id = 1
```

You can use [extension wallet](/wallet/Basic%20functions#request-testnet-alph-using-extension-wallet)
or [desktop wallet](/wallet/Basic%20functions#request-testnet-alph-using-desktop-wallet)
to obtain some `ALPH` from the testnet faucet.

### Mining

To maintain the stability of the testnet, only [specific addresses](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/fb4c4947ee0d0c57424d74ea197f19e72dc46c60/protocol/src/main/scala/org/alephium/protocol/ALPH.scala#L104) are allowed to mine blocks. If you need to test mining, you can set up your own testnet using [this docker project](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-stack/tree/master/mining-pool-local-testnet).

## Devnet

Local devnet is essential for developing and testing your dApps. It can be
launched using similar steps as `Mainnet` with Docker or Java.

### Using Docker

Follow the same
[steps](/full-node/getting-started#using-docker) for `Mainnet`,
except that under `$path-to-alephium-stack` there is a `devnet`
directory:

```shell
> cd $path-to-alephium-stack/devnet
> docker-compose up -d
```

### Using Java

Follow the same [steps](/full-node/getting-started#using-java) for
`Mainnet`, with the extra step of overriding the default
[user.conf](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-stack/blob/master/devnet/devnet.conf)
file under your `ALEPHIUM_HOME` directory, by default it is
`~/.alephium/user.conf`.

## What's Next

### Load from snapshot

The initial run of a `Mainnet` full node could takes up to ~20 hours
to fully sync with the other nodes in the network. To speed up this
process, snapshots are made available. Please refer to the Load from
snapshot guide for more information.

### Swagger UI

Alephium full node exposes the Swagger
UI which can be used to
interact with it. For your local full node, Swagger UI is available at
[http://127.0.0.1:12973/docs](http://127.0.0.1:12973/docs).

Alternatively, you can use any OpenAPI clients to
import the latest
[openapi.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephium/alephium/master/api/src/main/resources/openapi.json)
or use `curl` command directly.

### Wallets

Alephium's full node also comes with a built-in node
wallet. You are also encouraged to use
[other wallets](/wallet) to manage your assets and interact
with the dApps.

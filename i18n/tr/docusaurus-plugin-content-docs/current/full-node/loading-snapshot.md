# Full node

The very first run of a full node, as described in the [getting started](./getting-started) takes few hours until 
it is fully in sync with the other nodes in the network, or said differently, until it downloaded a copy of the entire blockchain.

In order to speed up this initial sync process, snapshots are available in the
[dedicated Alephium Archives repository](https://archives.alephium.org). An automated process upload snapshots
for both [testnet](https://archives.alephium.org/#testnet/) and [mainnet](https://archives.alephium.org/#mainnet/) networks.

## Downloading a snapshot

When preparing the full node for its first run, just before launching it, you can download the latest snapshot and
extract (it's a `tar` file) it at the right location. The snippet below even does this inline, i.e. without doubling the
required disk space to download and to extract the snapshot:

```shell
ALEPHIUM_HOME=~/.alephium
ALEPHIUM_NETWORK=mainnet
curl -L "$(curl -sL https://archives.alephium.org/archives/$ALEPHIUM_NETWORK/full-node-data/_latest.txt)" | tar xf - -C "$ALEPHIUM_HOME/"
```

A specific file `_latest.txt` is updated for your convenience, always pointing to the latest snapshot available.

## Using a ready-made script

While the command given above works, it does not cover all the edge failure cases that can happen and can lead the full node
database in an inconsistent state. Luckily a ready-to-use script will help you with this task.

```shell
ALEPHIUM_HOME=/tmp
ALEPHIUM_NETWORK=mainnet
curl -L https://github.com/touilleio/alephium-standalone/raw/main/snapshot-loader.sh | env ALEPHIUM_HOME=${ALEPHIUM_HOME} ALEPHIUM_NETWORK=${ALEPHIUM_NETWORK} sh
```

## Launching a standalone container

And finally if you want to try this setup quickly, an OCI image, simply extending the official `alephium/alephium` image, is doing all the steps
describe above automagically: `touilleio/alephium-standalone`. [Its source code](https://github.com/touilleio/alephium-standalone)
provides all the required details around its usage.

A quick reference command to run the standalone container is given below for convenience:

```
ALEPHIUM_HOME=/tmp
ALEPHIUM_NETWORK=mainnet
docker run -p 39973:39973 -p 127.0.0.1:12973:12973 \
  -v ${ALEPHIUM_HOME}:/alephium-home/.alephium \
  -e ALEPHIUM_NETWORK=${ALEPHIUM_NETWORK} touilleio/alephium-standalone:latest
```

# Explorer database

[Alephium Archives repository](https://archives.alephium.org) is also populated with explorer database snapshots. The snapshot
can be loaded in the postgresql database of the explorer backend at the first run, using the command below:

```shell
ALEPHIUM_NETWORK=mainnet
curl -L $(curl -L -s https://archives.alephium.org/archives/${ALEPHIUM_NETWORK}/explorer-db/_latest.txt) | gunzip -c | psql -U $pg_user -d $database
```

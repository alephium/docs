## Requirements

Ensure that Java (11 or 17 is recommended) is installed on your computer:

- Windows or macOS: [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- Ubuntu: run `sudo apt install default-jdk` in Terminal

## Download Application File

Download file `alephium-x.x.x.jar` from [Github release](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/releases/latest) (do not double click on it, it can not be launched this way).

## Start your node

1. Open the search and type in `Terminal` (for Mac and Ubuntu) or `Command Prompt` (for Windows).
2. In the Terminal/Command Prompt program, type `cd your-jar-file-path` to enter the folder in which the **alephium-x.x.x.jar** file is saved.
3. Type the following command and press Enter to launch the full node:
   ```shell
   java -jar alephium-x.x.x.jar
   ```

ðŸŽ‰ _**Tada, your node is running**_

- Your node will start to sync with the network. It might take long the first time. Your node has been fully synced once the block height in the terminal logs is equal to the one found in the latest blocks of the [explorer].
- If you close the terminal the node will be turned off.
- All of the blockchain data is stored in `.alephium` under your home folder[^1].

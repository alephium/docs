# Configure a Mining Wallet

A mining wallet is slightly different and needs to have **one address per group**. Currently, Alephium is running 4 groups, meaning it is needed to have 4 addresses. The desktop wallet can generate them easily for you.

To do this, simply unfold the `Advanced Settings` in the welcome screen at the end of the wallet creation process.

Alternatively, you can create additional addresses manually after you log into your wallet by going to the `Addresses` tab, click on the `Advanced operations` icon and choose `Generate one address per group`

# Alephium Intro

This wiki contains the documentation of [Alephium](https://github.com/alephium/alephium), a sharded blockchain that makes programmable money scalable and secure.

## Overview

The protocol's innovations extend battle-tested ideas from [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/):

- BlockFlow algorithm based on UTXO model enables sharding and scalability for today (code + [algorithm paper](https://github.com/alephium/research/blob/master/alephium.pdf))
  - The first sharding algorithm that supports `single-step cross-shard transactions`, offering the same user experience as single chain
  - Simple and elegant `PoW based sharding`, does not rely on beacon chain
- `Stateful UTXO model` combines the advantages of both eUTXO model and account model (see code, wiki to come)
  - Tokens are first-class citizens and UTXO-based, which are `owned by users` directly instead of contracts
  - Offer the same expressiveness as `account model`. DApps can be easily built on top of it with better security
  - Support `multiple participants` in a single smart contract transaction. Multiple calls can be packed into a single transaction too.
- Novel VM design resolves many critical challenges of dApp platforms (see code, wiki to come)
  - Less IO intensive
  - Flash loan is not available by design
  - Eliminate many attack vectors of EVM, including unlimited authorization, double dip issue, reentrancy attack, etc
  - UTXO style `fine-grained execution model` reduces risk-free arbitrage
- `Front-running mitigation` through random execution of transactions (see code, wiki to come)
- PoLW algorithm reduces the energy consumption of PoW in the long term ([research paper](https://github.com/alephium/research/blob/master/polw.pdf))
  - Adaptive rewards based on hashrate and timestamp are designed and implemented
  - Internal mining cost through burning will be added when hashrate and energy consumption is significantly high

Alephium offers a scalable, secure and decentralized platform for
building decentralized applications (DApps). In this section, you can
learn about [Ralph](/ralph), the smart contract
programming language for Alephium, and the [Web3
SDK](/sdk/getting-started), which offers powerful tools to
interact with the blockchain and a developer friendly framework
for compiling, testing and deploying smart contracts.

## Getting Started with a template

The easiest way to get started with building dApps on Alephium is to use one of the available templates.

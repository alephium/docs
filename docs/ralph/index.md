title: The Ralph Language
---

Ralph is the smart contract programming language for the Alephium blockchain, focusing on three goals: security, simplicity and efficiency. The following principles guide the design of Ralph:

1. Keep the smart contract DSL as simple as possible.
2. Ensure there is one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to accomplish tasks.
3. Incorporate good practices as built-in features.

This documentation offers tips for writing clean, idiomatic, and secure Ralph smart contracts. You may also find the [Smart Contracts Development in Ralph](https://ralph.alephium.org/) guide helpful.
